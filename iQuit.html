                            <h1>I Quit!</h1>
                            <p>If anyone has ever wondered, "Should I quit my job?", then I understand.  I wanted to quit for many years but I just wasn't ready.  There 
                                    are many reasons people stay on. Mine were: <ul>
                                    <li>15 minute commute!</li>
                                    <li>5 weeks of vacation!</li>
                                    <li>Paycheck!</li>
                                    <li>Sense of security</li>
                                    <li>The people - how could I leave the folks that depended on me?</li>
                                    <li>It was comfortable.  I knew pretty much what to expect.</li>    
                                    </ul> 
                                    Unfortunately, I didn't like my job though.  I was doing something I had done for many years and I wanted to expand my horizons.  Learn something new.  Something challenging.  Something exciting.
                                    So, that lead me to my decision. I needed to quit.  
                                </p>
                                <p>But how could I do it?  I didn't have enough skills in something else to get a job.  Heck, even my company only wanted me for one job. They had no desire to train me in something else, even if I was 
                                    an awesome employee and there were open positions in the company that I could have filled (they wanted somebody with experience).  What to do?
                                    I started looking for classes to take, but couldn't really find anything.  Nothing seemed to fit what I wanted.  Then one day I received an email 
                                    from some guy named Jeff who ran a local user group.  He was reminding me of the next meetup, and at the very bottom of the email was a note saying new classes were starting for a coding bootcamp.  What?  Really?!?  
                                    I think this is what I want to do!  
                                </p>
                                <p>But, at the time things seemed to be improving a little at work.  We were getting more organized and I was assigned as the lead on a pretty important project.  Maybe I should just hang on and give it a chance. 
                                     Maybe things will work out. I worked my tail off on that project - even worked weekends and  
                                    successfully implemented it.  I must say I did an excellent job.  No complaints from the users.  Then the next project came, and I was back to where I was before.  I didn't want to be doing what I was doing.  I needed out.
                                </p>
                                <p>So, I did it.  I quit.  It was terrifying.  Saying to my boss that I was leaving was one of the harder things I have had to do.  I was 
                                    worried that everyone would be angry with me.  But they weren't.  They were so supportive and excited about me going to school (and I think maybe a little envious).  What a relief! 
                                </p>
                                <p>Now I am in class writing a blog post for an assignment.  I am on the path to finally doing what I want to do.  Yay!</p>
